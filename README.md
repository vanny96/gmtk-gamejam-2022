3. Configure Unity for version control
   With your project open in the Unity editor:

   - Open the editor settings window. (Edit > Project Settings > Editor)
   - Make .meta files visible to avoid broken object references. (Version Control / Mode: “Visible Meta Files”)
   - Use plain text serialization to avoid unresolvable merge conflicts. (Asset Serialization / Mode: “Force Text”)
   - Save your changes. (File > Save Project)
